Important: use underscores instead of spaces in the names that you create

How to create a new card:

1. Create a new 'folder' in the Resources/Cards/{Units||Buildings||Spells}/ path with the name of the new card

2. Inside the 'folder' right-click and create a new ScriptableObject of the suitable type (e.g UnitCardData) with the name of the new card

3. Inside the 'folder' create a C# script with the name of the new card

	3.1 If you want the card to have an effect, the script can implement the IEffectWhenSpawning or IEffectWithTargetWhenSpawning interfaces
	     Notes: IEffectWithTarget currently can only target the hex chosen for the deployment of the card; and
		    if you are creating a spell remember to call "Destroy(this.gameObject);" at the end of the effect

4. If you are creating a unit or a building, you will need to create a material with the name of the new card in the 'folder'.
   Add as albedo texture the same sprite used in the Scritable object of step 2.

5. Finally, add the card to the catalogue by opening the CardCatalogue file and adding the line:
	public static CardCatalogueEntry DesiredCardName = new CardCatalogueEntry("DesiredCardName", CardType.DesiredCardType);
